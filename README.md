   Case Study Briefing: Flight Status and Notifications System
The Flight Status and Notifications System is designed to provide real-time updates and notifications to passengers about their flight status, including delays, cancellations, and gate changes. The system aims to enhance the passenger experience by ensuring timely and accurate information dissemination.

Key Features:

Real-Time Updates:

Display current flight status (e.g., delays, cancellations, gate changes) using a dynamic and responsive web interface built with React.js.
Utilize WebSockets to ensure real-time data updates on the frontend.
Push Notifications:

Implement a robust notification system to alert passengers via SMS, email, or app notifications about changes in flight status.
Use Kafka for message brokering to handle notification queues efficiently.
Integrate with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications to mobile devices.
Integration with Airport Systems:

Pull accurate flight data from airport databases, using mock data to simulate real-world scenarios.
Develop a backend service with Python Flask to fetch, process, and serve flight data.
Technologies Used:

Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS for creating a user-friendly interface.
Backend: Python Flask for API development and data handling.
Database: MongoDB for flexible schema storage and PostgreSQL for structured data.
Notifications: Kafka for message brokering, FCM for push notifications, and services like Twilio and SendGrid for SMS and email notifications.
Project Structure:

Backend: Python Flask server for APIs and Kafka producer for notifications.
Frontend: React components for flight status display and notification settings.
Database: MongoDB and PostgreSQL for storing flight data and user information.
Deployment:

The code is organized in a GitHub repository, with a clear README for setup instructions.
The backend runs on http://localhost:5000 and the frontend on http://localhost:3000.
This system ensures passengers are always informed about their flight status, improving their travel experience by reducing uncertainty and enhancing communication.
